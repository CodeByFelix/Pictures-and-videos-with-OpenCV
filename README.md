# Pictures-and-videos-with-OpenCV
This app enables you to take pictures and record videos with your webcam. The program was written in cpp using the OpenCV framework. You can take pictures by pressing c on the keyboard, and record video by pressing s on the keyboard. The app saves the files in real time by reading the system current time, using it as the file name.
Each file is being saved by reading the current time and date. For videos, "VID" is added and saved with the extension ".mp4", and for images, "IMG" is added and saved with the extension ".jpg".

The app is still a console app and i plan to modify it in the future and also add a framework that will be used to capture audio why recording the video.
